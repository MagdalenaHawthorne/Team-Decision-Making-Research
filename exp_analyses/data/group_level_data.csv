13,h_noTMS,version 2,B,22.54,Heidelberg,did not know each other,
14,h_noTMS,version 1,C,10.1,Heidelberg,did not know each other,maybe exclude because of simple version
16,so_TMS,version 3,C,11.3,Heidelberg,did not know each other,
17,so_TMS,version 5,C,14.4,Heidelberg,did not know each other,
18,so_noTMS,version 5,B,43.2,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"one guy (though young) assumed kind of a leadership role, he was very dominant and biased towards B. The discussion was particularly long, however, as another guy was not willing to make a decision. The girl was mostly withdrawn and excluded, she indicated in the servey that she was not identified with the group (hidden hierarchical"
19,h_TMS,version 5,B,23,Heidelberg,did not know each other,leader talked more than the others
20,so_noTMS,version 5,B,22.1,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"one member was clearly moderating the discussion, the girl felt dominated, potentially ""hidden hierachical"""
21,so_noTMS,version 4,C,22.3,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"collected much information, extremely balanced conversation, members were harmonious "
22,h_TMS,version 4,B,31,Heidelberg,knew each other,"leader was anal, which is why it took relatively long; it was slightly problematic that they knew each other because that undermined the hierarchical manipulation, potentially exclude (in the last question, members revealed that they knew it was about the group structure and the influence of the leader, i.e. they were aware of the manipulation)"
40,so_noTMS,version 4.1,C,15.02,Regensburg,did not know each other,defined great strategy in the beginning and collected almost all the information available
41,h_TMS,version 4.1,C,15.3,Regensburg,did not know each other,leader was considerate of the members' expertise but guided the conversation 
23,h_noTMS,version 4,C,13.4,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader was very structured and collected all the information, she was not particularly dominant but made her decision independently against member's opinion; example for a strong competent leader"
24,so_TMS,version 4 ,B,20.4,Regensburg,did not know each other,one member was a bit more dominant than the others and had kind of a leader role 
25,h_TMS,version 2,A,20.15,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader made her decision independently (and made the wrong one in this case, although she had enough information to be informed); good example of thr damaging effect of individual opinion"
26,so_noTMS,version 2,B,24,Regensburg,knew each other,"mentioned preference early, decision was not unanimous "
27,so_TMS,version 2,C,26.06,Regensburg,did not know each other,"one member wanted to exchange preferences first, another member jumped in and suggested to get the full picture instead first --> could demonstrate that the better strategy is more likely to be developed when more people are responsible for mapping out a strategy; also, members corrected information that was misremembered by one guy which is more likely to happen in so_teams; discussion was very controversial; they really discussed a lot and long because it was not an unanimous decision --> very engaged   "
28,h_TMS,version 4,C,10.42,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader considered expertise and determined a good strategy, collected information quickly; all girls remembered information very well which added to solvong it, leader was mostly just moderating but it is a good example for an effective leader!!"
29,so_noTMS,version 4,C,20.35,Regensburg,did not know each other,"immediately developed and discussed strategy to proceed, thus disseminated information well, everyone contributed, there was no clearly more dominant person, although one member was a bit quiet"
30,h_noTMS,version 4,B,9.05,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader gave kind of commands and was relatively dominant, he summarized the pilot profiles but did not start a discussion, short meeting!!"
31,so_TMS,version 4,C,30,Regensburg,did not know each other,"clearified their expert status in the beginnen, then wrote down all the remembered information, then they extensively discussed about all candidates, "
32,so_noTMS,version 4,A,13.41,Regensburg,did not know each other,"mentioned preferences immediately, which led to one-sided cosideration of information, example for groupthink! "
33,so_TMS,version 4,C,15.2,Regensburg,did not know each other,"did neither write down information in the beginning nor considered expertise; later they systematically gathered information to compare 2 pilots, open communication, controversial "
34,h_TMS,version 4,B,11.37,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader considered expertise and extracted information from participants, wrote it down, repeated information but did not encourage discussion "
35,h_noTMS,version 4,B,9.35,Regensburg,two knew each other,"leader acted quite professionally, asked very quickly about preferences instead of going through the set of information, was more talkative than the others, ended the meering too quickly!"
37,so_noTMS,version 4.1,C,12.1,Regensburg,two knew each other,easy task version which is why it was a quick round !!; one member suggested a good strategy in the beginning which everyone agreed to
38,so_TMS,version 4.1,C,10.5,Regensburg,two knew each other,"mentioned preferences early but then considered expertise and collected information properly, very equal status of members, rather short discussion because of easy version"
39,h_noTMS,version 4.1,C,26.4,Regensburg,two knew each other,"leader sturctured the meeting well, she was definitely more influential and talkative but created a good atmosphere, and took her time, positive example for leadership role"
42,h_noTMS,version 4.1,C,8.3,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader was dominant and immediately mentioned her own preference which happened to be C because of simple task, is NOT a positive example despite right solution but shows how detrimental hierarchy can be --> leader's gutt feeling determined the course of the discussion"
43,so_noTMS,version 4,C,21.51,Regensburg,two knew each other,"again, group discussed strategy initially until a good strategy was found and agreed on, collected information systematically, although they were already leaning towards C agter collecting and looking at all the information, they still discussed extensively and weighed the items, balanced discussion  "
44,h_TMS,version 4,B,21,Regensburg,did not know each other,"expertise was considered relatively well, leader was not super strong but talked more, he let members voice their final opinion, example for weak leader who gave in to group pressure"
45,so_TMS,version 4,C,23,Regensburg,knew each other,"discussed strategy first (!), one member had a stupid idea, another one had a good idea, good idea won, long discussion"
46,so_TMS,version 4,B,16.11,Regensburg,did not know each other,"pretty close to C but members intuition and group think got in the way, not a unanimous decision, they should have discussed more"
84,so_noTMS,version 4,C,17.54,Walldorf,knew each other,"did not remember so much initially but gathered information first and there was one advocate for C who prevented early decision pro B, balanced between the three re talking time"
85,so_TMS,version 4,C,12.4,Walldorf,knew each other,"very calm, equal discussion with structured dissemination of information --> faster with TMS?"
87,h_TMS,version 4,A,20.04,Walldorf,did not know each other,"at the beginning of the session, leader gave a nice introduction but did not collect information well at first but let others express their preferences, she led the discussion well but in a democratic fashion, the other participants had strong biases and were two dominant guys which ultimately prevented discussion about right solution and a not particularly hierachical discussion"
88,so_TMS,version 4,C,15.22,Walldorf,knew each other,"WEIRD: pretty boring discussion, they even mentioned preferences early on! They did not even consider expertise. I don't know why they got it right... "
90,h_noTMS,version 4,C,30,Walldorf,did not know each other,"EXEPTION: leader was very structured and suggested several good strategies, she was not dominant and encouraged a looong discussion that ultimately led to the right decision --> positive example for leadership"
91,so_noTMS,version 4,B,11.38,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"bias towards B was expressed early on, did not follow a good strategy and did not discuss long enough but it was still an egalitarian group"
92,so_TMS,version 4,C,26.19,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"well balanced discussion, disseminated information based on a strategy they had agreed on in the beginng, did not express preferences early on "
93,h_TMS,verison 4,B,9.2,Heidelberg,did not know each other,leader was not particularly assertive but closed the session way too quickly without further discussion
94,so_TMS,version 4,C,20.36,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"one person wanted to just mention preferences initially but then the others offered a better suggestion and pushed through a strategy to collect information first, it was a good example for a group where an equal status can lead to more diverse opinions and ultimately to a better outcome "
95,h_noTMS,version 4,B,11.06,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"it was a pain in the as again because the leader was not assetive, typical for a lot of hierarchical groups was that he finished the meeting raher quickly, he was influenced by the members' bias towards B"
96,h_TMS,version 4,A,19.5,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"leader started the meeting with a professionel welcoming talk and introduced her strategy, she used ""Sie"" which I liked and really played her role, still being fair but made an independent decision "
97,h_noTMS,version 4,A,9.4,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"leader asked about preferences immediately, which led to a suboptimal dissemination of information that was biased towards A, also short meeting  "
98,so_noTMS,version 4,C,43.21,Heidelberg,knew each other,"discussed strategy initially and went for a good one, very CONTROVERSIAL discussion, it took very long"
48,so_noTMS,version 4,C,25.03,Regensburg,knew each other,one member wanted to discuss preferences but another one suggested collecting the information first; prettey equal contribution of members
49,so_TMS,version 4,C,20.11,Regensburg,knew each other,systematic dissemination of information in the beginning; everyone contributed; weighed up the pros and cons carefulley before making their decision 
50,h_noTMS,version 4,B,16.05,Regensburg,two knew each other,leader suggested strategy that was smart but then members mentioned preferences immediately; leader guided the discussion well but emphasized one item about B such that bias became stronger; she dominated the exchange although being very nice
51,so_noTMS,version 4,B,14.01,Regensburg,did not know each other,"BAD EXAMPLE/ MAYBE EXCLUDE because one member felt suppressed: they collected information well but one member had a strong bias against C and was more influential than the others; it was close though between B and C, discussion did not last very long…if it had, maybe they might have decided pro C!! One member was pro C but did not raise her voice "
52,h_TMS,version 4,C,12.1,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader decided against the group members who strongly advocated B (leader asked about their favourites). She seemed to simply collect information and had a strong will. Initially, she was leaning towards A. She used the meta-knowledge to structure the discussion"
53,so_noTMS,version 4,A,12.46,Regensburg,knew each other,"stupid group, girls who didn't consider that they had DIFFERENT pieces of information, boring meeting"
54,so_TMS,version 4,C,23.43,Regensburg,did not know each other,"well balanced, structured discussion, collection of information in the beginning after agreeing to a strategy, started with the expert on the respective pilot"
55,h_TMS,version 4,B,15,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader didn't write things down; real discussion, not very systematic; leader referred to expertise a little bit, though; I'd expect the leader to have had a higher percentage of talking"
56,h_noTMS,verison 4,B,14.48,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader was annoyed and didn't seem very active, he did not create a positive atmosphere and simply extracted informatione from the members; interestingly, he decided against his own opinion and considered member's preferences; he behaved like an annoyed leader, though"
57,so_noTMS,version 4,C,18.19,Regensburg,two knew each other,"well balanced discussion, strategic beginning (discussed strategy first) "
76,h_noTMS,version 4,B,13.41,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"leader was actually more talkative than the others, discussion was not very lively or controversial "
77,so_TMS,version 4,C,16.46,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"collected information perfectly in the beginning, decision seemed easy, once they had gathered the pieces of information; unanimous decision"
78,h_TMS,version 4,C,18.05,Heidelberg,two knew each other," introverted leader girl, structured approach, not really hierachical !!!!!! (maybe exclude from mediator analyses as people did not have the feeling of a hierarchy)"
79,h_noTMS,version 4,A,10.3,Heidelberg,two knew each other,"leader was actually kind of dominant, he instructed the other members to answer questions, also he made his own (wrong) decision"
80,h_noTMS,version 4,A,16.38,Heidelberg,two knew each other,"potentially exclude: leader was not strong, she seemed completely overwhelmed, I was really annoyed what a pussy she was, she did not choose a strategic approach "
81,h_TMS,version 4,C,15.28,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"leader suggested a structured way of going about it and gave instructions to the others (in a friendly way though), based on the pretty extensive set of information they had collected every one was leaning towards C"
82,h_TMS,version 4,C,13.35,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"leader introduced strategy for selection, it was very quiet during the meeting, but he considered the experitse well (good example for using meta-knowledge)"
83,h_noTMS,version 4,B,9.5,Heidelberg,did not know each other,"GOOD EXAMPLE for hierarchy: the girl who was the leader was actually dominant, had no problem guiding, the meetings was ended quickly, such that the right solution could not be found by then"
58,so_TMS,version 4,C,21.11,Regensburg,did not know each other,"did not remember everthing well but first gathered information based on expertise, one girl was not as motivated as the others; however it was a long intense exchange and discussion "
59,h_noTMS,version 4,B,17.36,Regensburg,did not know each other,"the guy in the group was an asshole who was pissed that he was not the leader and very dominant, influencing the leader in the end"
60,h_TMS,version 4,B,13.16,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader finished the discussion too quickly, did not listen to one member very much who preferred the right candidate but it was close, so could be C"
61,so_noTMS,version 4,C,15.09,Regensburg,did not know each other,"pretty well balanced group, collected information first without judging, decision about strategy in the beginning; "
62,so_TMS,version 4,C,22.34,Regensburg,did not know each other,did not remember things well but first gathered information based on expertise and their discussion was controversial
63,h_noTMS,version 4,B,13.12,Regensburg,two knew each other,"leader did not guide the discussion at all, she finished the session quickly, then added her own information "
64,h_TMS,version 4,C,12.44,Regensburg,did not know each other,"POSITIVE EXAMPLE OF HIERARCHY + TMS: it was not super hierarchical but leader was highly efficient, collected the information in a structured way, added her own and then took her time to decide"
65,so_noTMS,verison 4,C,17.37,Regensburg,did not know each other,"intense, lively discussion, everyone contributed, they were not even very structured but expressed different opinions, voting was not unanimous, one candidate wanted B until the end"
66,h_noTMS,version 5,B,13.01,Regensburg,did not know each other,"the leader was a moderator and structured the meeting very properly, the discussion was not long and she decided independently"
67,so_noTMS,version 4,C,17.1,Regensburg,two knew each other,"well balanced, clear strategy to collect information in the beginning, precice in terms of actual wording of information pieces, they prevented jumping to conclusions; nice formal agreement at the end "
68,so_noTMS,version 4,C,12.25,Regensburg,did not know each other,mentioned preference early on but then slowly disseminated information and overcame their shared bias; interesting example for overcoming a bias and preventing a premature decision
69,h_noTMS,version 4,A,13.55,Regensburg,did not know each other,"the leader, again, functioned as a moderator and basically asked for everyone's opinion but discussion was not very controversial"
70,so_TMS,version 4,C,18.1,Regensburg,did not know each other,"did not use the meta-knowledge super well but had controversial opinions and one member (3) was stonger than the others and advocated C, such that the manipulation check shows a discripancy in power "
71,h_TMS,version 4,C,12.29,Regensburg,knew each other,"leader did not let the others inluence him so much, collected information and then chose C independently after a reflection period, both members preferred B"
72,h_noTMS,version 4,A,7.3,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader was actually leading and mentioned her preference immediately, she excluded C quickly, the other members were not as involved"
73,h_TMS,version 4,C,12.46,Regensburg,did not know each other,"leader deligated writing task and collected information in a structured way, considering people's expertise, had almost full set of information, members were split into B and C advocates, leader wanted C"
74,so_TMS,version 4,C,19.07,Regensburg,did not know each other,"did not consider meta-knowledge so well, discussed for a while and intensely, however, and remembered most pieces of information, such that two members ended up preferring C, one participant was a strong influencer"
75,h_TMS,version 4,C,18.2,Regensburg,did not know each other,leader was very organized and considered expertise well but was also talkative and came to the right conclusion
